To extract data of doctors from Indian academy of Pediatrics website

I was contacted by a medical professional who asked me to get the data of pediatricians from the website for particular states,categorized according to their districts, so that he and his group of friends can hconnec with them and possibly help.

The program uses the search bar on the website where it searches for the state and then extracts the data for the doctors from the individual search results such as address and contact info. 

This data is then exported to an excel file.
